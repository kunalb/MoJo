		<h2>Challenge #1&mdash;Unlocking Video</h2>

		<p>As an engineering student my approach to the challenge is along the lines of what could be technically achieved by mixing various web based technologies rather than from inside a newsroom&mdash;which is beyond my experience.</p>

		<p>This presentation is a combination of ideas, as there are too many inter-connected aspects of re-imagining news videos to neatly break them down. I've divided it on the basis of what stage the video happens to be at.</p>

		<h1>Sourcing Material</h1>
		<p>As recent events in Egypt and around the world have shown, citizen journalism -- a socialized form of news can be extremely effective. Not using the hundreds of thousands of cameras around the world to spread news and stories would be a rather major waste.</p>
		<p>Videos can be either professionally shot by news channels themselves or sourced from appropriately licensed citizen journalists videos--any video meant to tell a story/spread information can no longer be just a sequence of images, rather:</p>
			<ul>	
				<li>Save metadata from while shooting the video: while it is possible to later extract large amounts of information from videos based on discussions on the MoJo mailgroup/etherpad, there is nothing that can be as accurate as the data collected at that point of time. Information to store includes:
				<ul>
					<li>Location/geodata--particularly from smartphones</li>
					<li>People within the videos--face recognition+social network API+resources for auto tagging</li>
					<li>Time of shoot, weather conditions</li>
					<li>Who actually shot the video</li>
					<li>Tags by people who made the video</li>
				</ul>
				Of course, all information must be opt in to avoid privacy concerns. This meta-data can probably be passed along as a json object with a predefined format.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Create special news app applications to allow recording videos, adding tags and other meta information as painlessly and intuitively as possible and share--hosted on both news websites and public servers.</p>
		<p>Create an extension to <a href = 'http://status.net'>Status.net</a> to allow sharing news videos in a twitter like feed--decentralized servers, easily follow/unfollow other users.</p>
		<p>Create plugins/extensions for popular blogging platforms like WordPress to allow spreading a new standard for video.</p>

		<h1>Creating Videos</h1>
		<p>Collecting videos, is of course--only the first part of the process--the harder part is making the large amounts of raw data coherent, useful and also to validate them--this is particularly where the news organizations come in.</p>
		<p>Combine the videos with cutting edge visualizations using existing javascript libraries like RaphaelJS, InfoVis, and including interactive maps and timelines indicating time and location data.</p>
		<p>A web application based video editor that can run on multiple platforms: this might not be particularly feasible as the net connection as well as processor usage might be too high.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = 'slide'>
		<h1>Consuming Videos</h1>
		<p>Release the videos in varios formats and resolutions so that they can be viewed comfortably on any device.</p>
		<p>Make the videos interactive: though this might sound particularly basic, add hyperlinks to videos &mdash; allow users to jump to videos within context, remembering the state of the previous video. Make moving between videos painless and easy.</p>
		<p>Allow commenting within videos and allow discussions and tags to appear when enabled. Video replies within the primary videos would allow full discussions.</p>
