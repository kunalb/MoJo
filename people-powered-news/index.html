		<h1>Hacking The Newsroom</h1>
		<p>This idea began with a <a href = 'https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.community.mojo/nsxBNCEVx_E'>discussion</a> on the <a href = 'https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/community-mojo'>MoJo mailing list</a> about how the challenge could be used to find solutions for what could be done in the newsroom.</p>

		<p>As a response to my question about what exactly went on in newsrooms, <a href ='https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.community.mojo/nsxBNCEVx_E/trsQ8T8JijUJ'>Ian</a> and <a href = 'https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.community.mojo/nsxBNCEVx_E/_N2QmQYW-z4J'>Jake</a> gave detailed replies about their daily workflow, with a lot of feedback from others. <a href = 'https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.community.mojo/Xp5Nhd5Bp8Y/NUunYt3AZz0J'>Bill</a> also has been giving feedback from a newsroom perspective. Jake and Adam talked about the need for and <a href = 'http://www.iptc.org/site/News_Exchange_Formats/IPTC_G2-Standards_-_about_which_one_do_you_want_to_know_more'>existing standards</a> for news publishing.</p>

		<p>Based on the discussion happening on the group, I decided to approach this challenge focussing on:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>There are many existing workflows, custom/proprietary CMSs being used in newsrooms at various scales. Any usable solution would have to be usable in <em>parts</em>, to allow easy integration.</li>
			<li>Being able to share the data from one application to the next as well as between content publishers requires a standardized format.</li>
			<li>Social Features to allow people to comment and discuss an article in progress.</li>
			<li>Hacking into the existing workflow for collaborative editing and creating visualizations.</p>
		</ul>
