		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>In this presentation I'm aiming at addressing modifying how discussions around news articles are created and moderated from a technical and user-oriented point of view. I'd decided to clarify this up front based on the recent discussions on the Mozilla forums.</p>

		<p>My response to this challenge centers around using existing communities to create meaningful and useful discussions around content in an open, distributed manner using mostly existing technologies.</p>

		<p>Improving the comment ecosystem essentially involves making any barrier whatsoever in making comments negligible, promoting meaningful and appropriate comments and hiding spammy ones while providing returns to both people who comment as well as the publisher.</p>

		<h1>An ideal commenting system</h1>

		<p>The article is treated as a first-among-equals on a topic: as much emphasis is given to the discussion as to the article itself.</p>

		<p>Every user has his own preferences about communities he joins, posts made&mdash;and if that particular community supports it&mdash;gains reputation for his comments. An ideal commenting system would automatically take a user's preferences into account by simply gauging which communities he is a part of (a simple check by seeing where all he is logged in) accordingly determining the user's interests and reorganizing comments accordingly: you get to see what you are most likely interested in.</p>

		<p>Comments get auto-tagged, and can be also custom tagged by the commentors themselves. A large problem in active discussions is reading and discussing those aspects of an article you want&mdash;thousands of comments simply get lost in the ether because they don't appear on the front page&mdash;tagging lets you reach where you want quickly.</p>

		<p>Comments can be blog posts, tweets, videos, sound files, pictures made through the platform of the user's choice without having to leave the original article; they get aggregated and displayed live on the article. There's nothing that can reduce enthusiasm about posting than having to constantly refresh the page to see new comments and replies.</p>
		
		<p>Facebook gained a lot of traction by adding the live-stream and notifications&mdash;having a way to notify users that someone replied to their comment would be really help help in engaging users.</p>

		<p>Comment quality can be improved by suggesting grammar/spelling corrections, instantaneous translation of any comment/the article itself; and ensuring that any comments shown within the site follow full accessibility guidelines.</p>

		<p>Atomic comments (comments on specific parts of an article) would, in my opinion, completely break the flow of a user reading the article. Instead, allow quoting the article/comments as simple as possible.</p>

		<p>Last, but not the least I would emphasize a highly simple non-overwhelming UI&mdash;design so good that the user does not notice it.</p>

		<h1>Technical Aspects</h1>

		<p>Auto determining where all a user is logged in can be determined using a, well, exploit detailed at <a href="https://grepular.com/Abusing_HTTP_Status_Codes_to_Expose_Private_Information">Grepular</a> by Mike Cardwell without actually saving any information about the user. To ensure user privacy, I would recommend that comment reordering be carried out client side only and be opt-in&mdash; that way any information about the user's communities is never sent back to the main server. A completely open source implementation of the comments system should also take care of any worries about security. With enough traction it might also be possible to ask communities to release a formal API that can be enabled so that only those sites that a user wants to show he is logged in to actually come up.</p>

		<p>Gaining karma and commenting directly through the article would depend on the communities involved and special permissions&mdash;a rather large amount of work would be required to make this as unobstrusive as possible.</p>

		<p>Ajax, server pushes, etc can allow live comments to show live updates on an article. Tagging can be carried out using any of the many context-extraction services available.</p>

		<p>Notifications can be handled by a simple Firefox/Chrome/&lt;Any Browser&gt; plugin&mdash;a central server for storing notifications for users to allow logging in from any device of their choice (perhaps piggy backing on how Firefox syncs browser information) that show a number indicating replies and an easy way to go back to old comments.</p>

		<p>Comment quality can be improved by integrating the open source project <a href = "http://afterthedeadline.com/">After the deadline</a> which is already available as a browser plugin and can be integrated into any website. Translations can be handled using google translate and various other API. Accessibility can be considered by following the <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA</a> guidelines.</p>

		<p>Quoting would be a simple matter of javascript to highlight the sentence a user is hovering on, etc.</p>

		<p>Unobstrusive design, of course would require a lot of testing, suggestions from the user&mdash;something along the lines of, but perhaps not the scale of, the firefox UI design work.</p>
